== What is the event bus?
The event bus is a means for sending and receiving messages in an asynchronous fashion.
The event bus allows for decoupling between verticles. There is no need for one verticle to access another verticle classâ€”all that is needed is to agree on destination names  and  data  representation.  

Communications over the event bus follow three patterns:

* Point-to-point messaging 
* Request-reply messaging 
* Publish/subscribe messaging

Event bus for verticle-to-verticle communications inside an application, not a message bus for application-to-application communications

Specifically, the event bus does not do the following:

* Support message acknowledgments 
* Support message priorities 
* Support message durability to recover from crashes 
* Provide routing rules 
* Provide transformation rules (schema adaptation, scatter/gather, etc.)

The event bus simply carries volatile events that are being processed asynchronously by verticles
