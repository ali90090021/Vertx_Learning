There are inevitably cases where you will have a hard time avoiding blocking code. It  may  happen  because  you  are  using  a  third-party  library  with  another  threading model,  such  as  drivers  for  some  networked  services.  Vert.x  provides  two  options  for dealing with such cases: worker verticles and the executeBlocking operation

== Worker verticles
Worker verticles are a special form of verticles that do not execute on an event loop. Instead,  they  execute  on worker  threads,  that  is,  threads  taken  from  special  worker pools

To  put  it  simply,  like  event-loop  verticles,  worker  verticles  are  single-threaded,  but unlike event-loop verticles, the thread may not always be the same
