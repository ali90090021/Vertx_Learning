== Deploying verticles


Verticles are always deployed (and undeployed) through the Vertx object. You can do so from any method, but the typical way to deploy an application composed of ver- ticles is as follows:
 
1- Deploy a main verticle.
 
2- The main verticle deploys other verticles.
 
3- The deployed verticles may in turn deploy further verticles.
